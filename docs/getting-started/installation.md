## Which method should I use?

| Method                              | Best for                         | Installs default-stack deps? | Auto-upgrades? |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| [Homebrew](#homebrew-recommended)   | macOS / Linux daily use          | Yes                          | `brew upgrade` |
| [Direct download](#direct-download) | CI, containers, air-gapped hosts | No                           | Manual         |
| [Source build](#build-from-source)  | Contributors, bleeding-edge      | No                           | Manual         |

**Most users should use Homebrew.** It installs `gc` plus the default backend
toolchain automatically and keeps `gc` on your PATH. Choose direct download
when you cannot use Homebrew (CI images, Docker layers, machines without
package managers). Choose source when you need unreleased changes or plan to
contribute.

## Prerequisites

Gas City's prerequisites depend on which session backend and beads backend you
actually run. Homebrew installs the default stack for you; the other methods
require manual installation of the rows that match your setup.

If you plan to follow the Quickstart exactly as written, install the default
stack: `tmux` for sessions plus `bd`, `dolt`, and `flock` for beads.

The exact versions CI pins are in [`deps.env`](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/blob/main/deps.env).

## Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install gastownhall/gascity/gascity
```

This taps the `gastownhall/gascity` formula, builds or fetches the `gc` binary,
and installs the default backend toolchain (`tmux`, `jq`, `git`, `dolt`,
`flock`, `beads`).

Verify the installation:

```bash
gc version
```

<Warning>
If you use Oh My Zsh with the `git` plugin, `gc` may already be an alias for
`git commit --verbose`. Run `command gc version` once to bypass the alias. For
a persistent fix, add `unalias gc 2>/dev/null` after Oh My Zsh loads in
`~/.zshrc`, or put that line in a file such as
`~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/gascity.zsh`.
</Warning>

### Upgrading via Homebrew

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade gascity
```

After upgrading, restart any running city so the supervisor picks up the new
binary:

```bash
gc service restart     # restarts the launchd/systemd service
```

`gc start` auto-regenerates the service file on each invocation, so a
`brew upgrade` followed by `gc start` always picks up template changes
(see [v0.13.3 release notes](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/releases/tag/v0.13.3)).

### Uninstalling via Homebrew

```bash
gc stop <city-path>                        # stop running city first
brew uninstall gascity
brew untap gastownhall/gascity             # remove the tap
```

## Direct download

Release tarballs are published for every tagged version. Supported platforms:

| OS             | Architecture          | Archive name                          |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| macOS (darwin) | Apple Silicon (arm64) | `gascity_VERSION_darwin_arm64.tar.gz` |
| macOS (darwin) | Intel (amd64)         | `gascity_VERSION_darwin_amd64.tar.gz` |
| Linux          | x86_64 (amd64)        | `gascity_VERSION_linux_amd64.tar.gz`  |
| Linux          | ARM (arm64)           | `gascity_VERSION_linux_arm64.tar.gz`  |

### Download and install

```bash
# Set the version you want (check https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/releases)
VERSION=0.13.3

# Detect platform
OS=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
ARCH=$(uname -m)
case "$ARCH" in
  x86_64)         ARCH=amd64 ;;
  aarch64|arm64)  ARCH=arm64 ;;
esac

# Download and extract
curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/releases/download/v${VERSION}/gascity_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz"
tar -xzf "gascity_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz"

# Move to a directory on your PATH
sudo install -m 755 gc /usr/local/bin/gc

# Verify
gc version
```

### Upgrading a direct-download install

Repeat the download steps above with the new version number. The `gc` binary is
a single static file — overwriting it is safe.

<Tip>
You still need to install the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) that match your
chosen session and beads backends when using direct download.
</Tip>

## Build from source

Requires `make` and Go 1.25+ (pinned in `go.mod`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity.git
cd gascity
make install        # builds and installs to $(GOPATH)/bin/gc
gc version
```

To build without installing globally:

```bash
make build          # outputs bin/gc in the repo root
./bin/gc version
```

On macOS, `make build` automatically ad-hoc code-signs the binary (`codesign -s -`).

### Contributor setup

After building, install the dev toolchain and pre-commit hooks:

```bash
make setup
make check          # runs fmt, lint, vet, and unit tests
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the full contributor workflow.

## Verify your installation

Regardless of install method, confirm everything is working:

```bash
gc version          # should print the installed version and commit
```

If that runs `git commit` instead of Gas City, your shell has a `gc` alias.
Use `command gc version` for this check and see
[Troubleshooting](/getting-started/troubleshooting#oh-my-zsh-git-plugin-hides-gc)
for the permanent fix.

Then create your first city:

```bash
gc init ~/my-city
cd ~/my-city
```

`gc init` registers the city with the supervisor and starts it automatically.
See the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) for a complete walkthrough.

## Docs preview

The docs site uses [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com). Preview locally from the
repo root:

```bash
./mint.sh dev
```

Or run a link check without starting the server:

```bash
make check-docs
```
